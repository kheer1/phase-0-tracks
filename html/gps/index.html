  <!  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
    That you can create auto fill-in and use that to help increase productivity. Right now I don't see myself create more snippets because each week we're doing something different but in the future, yes.

<!    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
