Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
They allow you to store large amounts of data

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
array = [] an array is a list of objects that are similar type like strings or numbers

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
	a student's test grades for math
	a list of movies you have on dvd
	
Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.

a hash is a list of items with unique keys and their values.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.

your friends names, birthdays, phone numbers 
movie titles and the actors and actresses in them

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?

It allows you to go through the entire array or hash

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.

finding your average grade for a subject if you have an array with your grades for each test and quiz
if you keep track how much you run everyday in an array, you can use iteration to find the average time you ran


Blocks
8. What is a block?
small piece of code that is reuseable 
9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
it's the value that you get from using a method, depending what method you use, you'll get a different block parameter value
